I recently got the chance to know about the STL(Standard Template Library ).
Till that moment i  thought that , the only difference about c and c++ is the 
class keyword and it is object oriented programming , and completely ignore the fact that. There are many useful libraries it also provide that can reduce the 
repetive work  while doing overloading of functions and data structure (and there function implementations ), here is an example to implement variable size array using vector header file .


{% highlight c++ %}
#include<vector> //header file for std::vector
...
int main(){
vector <int> v; // declaring a vector  : vector <data_type> var_name;
int k;          //to get the value to be enter into the vector 
cin>>k;
v.push_back(k); //push_back() is one of the function to enter the value into vector

cout<<v[0];     //and you can accessed the value inside the variable like in array 
cout<<V.size()  //as the size of vector can be change it try to keep track of number of element in it , can be helpful while parsing .                
}

{% endhighlight %}
